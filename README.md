# Course Project at Coursera-UoA-Astro101: Escape Velocities

Computes the escape velocities for important celestial objects.

This project is an initiative of mine, that is, it is not part of the course.

Consider that Python doesn't have constants, so the uppercase variables are just a convention for declaring
"constants".

## Getting started

Run the program with

``python ./src/main.py``

Run the tests with

``python ./src/test.py``

## Instructions

Create a program to compute escape velocities and print those of the celestial objects seen in the course (e.g. Earth,
Moon, Sun, Black Hole, etc.).

lecture: [01.08 – Escape Velocity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/black-holes-astro-101/lecture/taSgE/01-08-escape-velocity).
